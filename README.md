# ✨ Custom Textarea Component ✨
I’ve built a custom textarea component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating a smooth, user-friendly experience with the following features:

🌟 Key Features: ✔️ Resizable: Users can adjust the size of the textarea dynamically. ✔️ Character Counter: Displays a live count of characters entered, helping users stay within limits. ✔️ Input Validation: Ensures proper handling of input based on defined constraints. ✔️ Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless use on various screen sizes and devices.

This project was a great opportunity to improve my JavaScript DOM manipulation skills and dive deeper into styling interactive elements.
